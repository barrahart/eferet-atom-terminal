#### A Terminal-inspired theme for [Atom](https://github.com/atom/atom "Atom on GitHub")

This theme is a fork of the [terminate-ui theme](https://github.com/keithalpichi/terminate-ui "terminate-ui on GitHub"), which is inspired by Apple's green default Terminal profile. There's not much of a difference between this fork and the original theme, just a few tweaks I thought I'd share with the world. Looks best when combined with the [terminal-syntax theme](https://github.com/sgtpepper43/terminal-syntax "terminal-syntax on GitHub").

I'll publish it as an official Atom theme soon. Please check out the [terminate-ui repo](https://github.com/keithalpichi/terminate-ui "terminate-ui on GitHub") for more info about the original theme.
